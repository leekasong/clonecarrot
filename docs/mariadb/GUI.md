# GUI tool for mariadb

## HeidiSQL
it's the GUI for mariadb, mysqldb, msql db, etc. <br>
it provides simple UI, easy configuration. <br>

in my case, MySQL workbench is hard to configure, even at the stage of connection to the db. <br>
so, i recommend to use HeidiSQL for the mariadb GUI tool. <br>

below the link is the guide that i refer. <br>
